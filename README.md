## General Information

- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
 
**Problem Statement**
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


## Conclusions
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes can focus more on Temperature.
- We can see demand for bikes was more in 2019 than 2018, so just focus as there is increase in 2019 and might be facing dips in their revenues
  due to the ongoing Corona pandemic and by the time it reduces the things will be better.
- We can see spring season has negative coefficients and negatively correlated to bike rentals. So we can give some offers there to increase the demand.
